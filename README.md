Semantic Kernel (SK) is an open-source SDK from Microsoft that allows users to build AI agents that can call existing code. SK integrates large language models (LLMs) like OpenAI, Azure OpenAI, and Hugging Face with programming languages like C#, Python, and Java. This allows users to combine existing code with these models to build agents that can answer questions and automate processes.

SK is highly extensible and can be used with models from OpenAI, Azure OpenAI, Hugging Face, and more. SK planners allow users to ask an LLM to generate a plan that achieves a user's goal, and then Semantic Kernel executes the plan for the user.

SK allows users to create single AI agents and equip them with the tools to do tasks. For example, a CRM plugin allows an AI to retrieve information about customers and make adjustments as new information comes in. An email plugin lets an AI send and receive emails on behalf of a user, and an inventory plugin gives an AI the ability to see what is in stock so it can give recommendations.

SK uses a prompt template, which is the natural language query or command that is sent to the LLM. SK also allows users to define plugins that can be chained together in just a few lines of code. 
Microsoft provides a list of best practice guidelines called the Shillace Laws of Semantic AI, which are learned from building LLM applications across Microsoft's business.
